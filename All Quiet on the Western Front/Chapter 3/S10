 Reinforcements have arrived. The vacancies have been filled and the sacks of straw in the huts are already booked. Some of them are old hands, but there are twenty-five men of a later draught from the base. They are about two years younger than us. Kropp nudges me: "Seen the infants?"
 I nod. We stick out our chests, shave in the open, shove our hands in our pockets, inspect the recruits and feel ourselves stone-age veterans.
 Katczinsky joins us. We stroll past the horseboxes and go over to the reinforcements, who are already being issued with gas masks and coffee.
 "Long time since you've had anything decent to eat, eh?" Kat asks one of the youngsters.
 He grimaces. "For breakfast, turnip-bread, lunch, turnip-stew, supper, turnip-cutlets and turnip-salad." Kat gives a knowing whistle.
 "Bread made of turnips? You've been in luck, it's nothing new for it to be made of sawdust. But what do you say to haricot beans? Have some?"
 The youngster turns red: "You can't kid me."
 Katczinsky merely says: "Fetch your mess-tin."
 We follow curiously. He takes us to a tub beside his straw sack. Sure enough it is half full of beef and beans. Katczinsky plants himself in front of it like a general and says: "Sharp eyes and light fingers! That's what the Prussians say."
 We are surprised. "Great guts, Kat, how did you come by that?" I ask him.
 "Ginger was glad I took it. I gave him three pieces of parachute-silk for it. Cold beans taste fine, too."
 Patronisingly he gives the youngster a portion and says: "Next time you come with your mess-tin have a cigar or a chew of tobacco in your other hand. Get me?" Then he turns to us. "You get off scot free, of course."
