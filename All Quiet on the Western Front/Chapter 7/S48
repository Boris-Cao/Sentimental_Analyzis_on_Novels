 So, after a time we find ourselves reassembled again. Leer is in high spirits. We pull on our boots and take our leave warmly. The night air cools our hot bodies. The rustling poplars loom large in the darkness. The moon floats in the heavens and in the waters of the canal. We do not run, we walk beside one another with long strides.
 "That was worth a ration-loaf," says Leer.
 I cannot trust myself to speak, I am not in the least happy. 
 Then we hear footsteps and dodge behind a shrub.
 The steps come nearer, close by us. We see a naked soldier, in boots, just like ourselves; he has a package under his arm, and gallops onward. It is Tjaden in full course. He has disappeared already.
 We laugh. In the morning he will curse us.
 Unobserved, we arrive again at our sacks of straw.
