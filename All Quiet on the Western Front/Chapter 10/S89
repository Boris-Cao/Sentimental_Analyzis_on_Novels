 After a few weeks I have to go each morning to the massage department. There my leg is harnessed up and made to move. The arm has healed long since.
 New convoys arrive from the line. The bandages. are no longer made of cloth, but of white crepe paper. Rag bandages have become scarce at the front.
 Albert's stump heals well. The wound is almost closed. In a few weeks he should go off to an institute for artificial limbs. He continues not to talk much, and is much more solemn than formerly. He often breaks off in his speech and stares in front of him. If he were not here with us he would have shot himself long ago. But now he is over the worst of it, and he often looks on while we play skat.
 I get convalescent leave.
 My mother does not want to let me go away. She is feeble. It is all much worse than it was last time.
 Then I am recalled to my regiment and return once more to the line.
 Parting from my friend Albert Kropp was very hard. But a man gets used to that sort of thing in the army.
