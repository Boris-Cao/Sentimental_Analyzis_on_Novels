 At noon the hospital inspector arrives and abuses us. He threatens us with clink and all the rest of it. But a hospital inspector is just the same as a commissariat inspector, or any one else who wears a long sword and shoulder straps, but is really a clerk, and is never considered even by a recruit as a real officer. So we let him talk. What can they do to us, anyway? "Who threw the bottle?" he asks.
 Before I can think whether I should report myself, someone says: "I did."
 A man with a bristling beard sits up. Everyone is excited; why should he report himself?
 "You?"
 "Yes. I was annoyed because we were waked up unnecessarily and lost my senses so that I did not know what I was doing."
 He talks like a book.
 "What is your name?"
 "Reinforcement-Reservist Josef Hamacher."
 The inspector departs.
 We are all curious. "But why did you say you did it? It wasn't you at all!"
 He grins. "That doesn't matter. I have a shooting licence."
 Then of course, we all understand. Whoever has a shooting licence can do just whatever he pleases.
 "Yes," he explains, "I got a crack in the head and they presented me with a certificate to say that I was periodically not responsible for my actions. Ever since then I've had a grand time. No one dares to annoy me. And nobody does anything to me."
 "I reported myself because the shot amused me. If they open the door again to-morrow we will pitch another."
 We are overjoyed. With Josef Hamacher in our midst we can now risk anything.
 Then come the soundless, flat trollies to take us away.
 The bandages are stuck fast. We bellow like steers.
