 In one part of the trench I suddenly run into Himmelstoss. We dive into the same dug-out. Breathless we are all lying one beside the other waiting for the charge.
 When we run out again, although I am very excited, I suddenly think: "Where's Himmelstoss?" Quickly I jump back into the dug-out and find him with a small scratch lying in a corner pretending to be wounded. His face looks sullen. He is in a panic; he is new to it too. But it makes me mad that the young recruits should be out there and he here.
 "Get out!" I spit.
 He does not stir, his lips quiver, his moustache twitches.
 "Out!" I repeat.
 He draws up his legs, crouches back against the wall, and shows his teeth like a cur.
 I seize him by the arm and try to pull him up. He barks.
 That is too much for me. I grab him by the neck and shake him like a sack, his head jerks from side to side.
 "You lump, will you get out? You hound, you skunk, sneak out of it, would you?" His eye becomes glassy, I knock his head against the wall: "You cow!" I kick him in the ribs: "You swine!" I push him toward the door and shove him out head first.
 Another wave of our attack has just come up. A lieutenant is with them. He sees us and yells: "Forward, forward, join in, follow." And the word of command does what all my banging could not. Himmelstoss hears the order, looks round him as if awakened, and follows on.
 I come after and watch him go over. Once more he is the smart Himmelstoss of the parade-ground, he has even outstripped the lieutenant and is far ahead.
