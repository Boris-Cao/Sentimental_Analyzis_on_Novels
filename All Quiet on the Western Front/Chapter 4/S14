 We have to go up on wiring fatigue. The motor lorries roll up after dark. We climb in. It is a warm evening and the twilight seems like a canopy under whose shelter we feel drawn together. Even the stingy Tjaden gives me a cigarette and then a light.
 We stand jammed in together, shoulder to shoulder, there is no room to sit. But we do not expect that. MÃ¼ller is in a good mood for once; he is wearing his new boots.
 The engines drone, the lorries bump and rattle. The roads are worn and full of holes. We dare not show a light so we lurch along and are often almost pitched out. That does not worry us, however. It can happen if it likes; a broken arm is better than a hole in the guts, and many a man would be thankful enough for such a chance of finding his home way again.
 Beside us stream the munition-columns in long files. They are making the pace, they overtake us continually. We joke with them and they answer back.
 A wall becomes visible, it belongs to a house which lies on the side of the road. I suddenly prick up my ears. Am I deceived? Again I hear distinctly the cackle of geese. A glance at Katczinsky; a glance from him to me; we understand one another.
 "Kat, I hear some aspirants for the frying-pan over there."
 He nods. "It will be attended to when we come back. I have their number."
 Of course Kat has their number. He knows all about every leg of goose within a radius of fifteen miles.
 The lorries arrive at the artillery lines. The gun-emplacements are camouflaged with bushes against aerial observation, and look like a kind of military Feast of the Tabernacles. These branches might seem gay and cheerful were not cannon embowered there.
